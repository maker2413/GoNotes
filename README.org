#+TITLE: Go Notes

This repo is just my playground to learn and try to take notes on things I learn
in Golang. These notes are not going to be a perfect read, but are rather
intended to be reference documents for snippets of knowledge or examples. These
notes are just little jots I make while I learn and will include spelling
mistakes, bad grammar, and a complete disregard for past, present, and future
tense. So far I have been following this guide:
https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/ and have been loving it.
