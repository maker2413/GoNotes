#+TITLE: The Factory Pattern

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern][Factory design pattern]] is a pattern that uses factory methods to deal with
the problem of creating objects. The factory pattern is commonly used in object
oriented programming language and isn't used as commonly in Go, but you will
encounter it. The code in this directory illustrates that we have a type called
~Product~ that can be initialized with the factory method ~New()~.
