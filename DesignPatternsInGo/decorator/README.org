#+TITLE: The Decorator Pattern

The decorator pattern is dead simple in Go. If it look at examples in other
languages it may look quite complex, but in Go it is really, really easy.

The goal of the decorator pattern is to take an object and decorate it with
additional information. All we have to do to accomplish this in Go is to take
the thing we want to decorate with additional information and wrap it in another
struct that has that additional information.
