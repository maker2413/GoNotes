#+TITLE: Design Patterns in Go

This directory just contains Notes and sample programs I made while working
through the "[[https://www.udemy.com/course/working-with-design-patterns-in-go-golang/][Design Patterns in Go]]" course on Udemy.

* Programs:
  The course begins by building out a simple web application and then goes
  through various design patterns before implementing them in the web
  application. I would work through the programs in this directory in the
  following order to follow along with the structure of the course:
  - 1. :: [[./webApp/][Simple Web Application]]
  - 2. :: [[./factory/README.org][Factory Pattern]]
  - 3. :: [[./abstractFactory/README.org][Abstract Factory Pattern]]
  - final :: [[./breeders/][Breeders]]

* Notes:
  Design Patterns pertinent to Go:
  - The Factory Pattern
  - Abstract Factory Pattern
  - Repository Pattern
  - Singleton Pattern
  - Builder & Fluent Interface
  - Adapter Pattern
