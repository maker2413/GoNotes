#+TITLE: The Adapter Pattern

The adapter pattern is one of the most useful patterns out there because it
makes maintaining code much easier. The adapter pattern:
- Allows us to have different programs (or parts of the same program) to
  communicate with one another.
- Example: a handler gets information from something, and expects it to be in
  JSON format.

To give a brief idea of how Go makes this incredibly easy. Let's assume that:
- The data comes from two different remote sources. One is in JSON, and one is
  in XML.
- The adapter allows us to get the XML data and convert it into what the handler
  expects.
- Using this allows us to make existing sections of code work with other
  sections, without modifying those sections.
