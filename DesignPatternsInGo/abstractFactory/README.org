#+TITLE: The Abstract Factory Pattern

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern][Abstract Factory Pattern]] is a slightly more complex version of the factory
pattern that creates families of related objects. For instance if we have a
factory that creates animals called ~Animals~ the factory should be able to
build out ~Dogs~ and ~Cats~ since they have similar traits with different
values. That is what the code included in this directory show cases.
