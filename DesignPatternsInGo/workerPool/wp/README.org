#+TITLE: Video Streaming Platform

This is a more involved example of the worker pool design pattern. In this
directory we are going to build out a couple of microservices for a fictional
video streaming platform.

There are two directories included in this project:
- 1. [[./streamer/]] This directory contains all of the video encoding logic.
- 2. [[./app/]] This directory contains an application that uses the streamer
  package.
