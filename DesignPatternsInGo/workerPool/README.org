#+TITLE: The Worker Pool Pattern

The worker pool is a really useful pattern that is also quite easy to implement
in Go. With the worker pool pattern we have units of work that are distributed
among a pool of workers, which run concurrently. This is very useful for long
running or processor intensive tasks.

With a Go implementation we can also take advantage of channels to handle
communication between workers. We will also be able to utilize Go routines for
our workers.

This directory also contains two examples of the worker pool pattern:
- 1. :: [[./simple/main.go][Simple Example]]
- 2. :: [[./wp/README.org][Advanced Example]]
