#+TITLE: The Builder Pattern

The builder pattern is a single design pattern that is used in two different
ways. The first one is a creational pattern known as the builder pattern. The
other variation of that is called the fluent interface.

Both versions of this pattern allow us to chain methods. Here is an example:
#+begin_src go
  p, err := pets.NewPetBuilder().
          SetSpecies("dog").
          SetWeight(15).
          SetDescription("A very good boy").
          SetColor("Black and White").
          SetAge(3).
          SetAgeEstimated(true).
          Build()
#+end_src
