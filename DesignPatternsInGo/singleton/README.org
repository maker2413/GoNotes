#+TITLE: The Singleton Pattern

The singleton pattern doesn't get a lot of use, but when you need it, it is
super helpful. As the name might imply the singleton pattern creates a single
object. There is more to it than that, but in simple terms it:
- Allows us to restrict the instantiation of something to a singular instance
- Is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a
  system.

I implemented the singleton pattern to the breeders program in the following
