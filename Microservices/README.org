#+TITLE: Microservices

This directory just contains Notes and sample programs I made while working
through the "[[https://www.udemy.com/course/working-with-microservices-in-go][Working with Microservices in Go]]" course on Udemy.

* Programs:
  I would work through the programs in this directory in the following order to
  follow along with the structure of the course:
  - 1. :: [[./front-end/][Front End]]
  - 2. :: [[./broker-service/][Broker Service]]
  - 3. :: [[./authentication-service/][Authentication Service]]
  - 4. :: [[./logger-service/][Logger Service]]
  - 5. :: [[./mail-service/][Mail Service]]
  - 6. :: [[./listener-service/][Listener Service]]

* Docker Swarm
  Here is how to bring it up. First go to the project directory and then run:
  #+begin_src shell
    docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.0.95
    docker stack deploy -c project/swarm.yml myapp
  #+end_src

  You can see running services with:
  #+begin_src shell
    docker service ls
  #+end_src

  To bring it all down you can run:
  #+begin_src shell
    docker stack rm myapp
  #+end_src

  To entirely leave the swarm you can run:
  #+begin_src shell
    # if you are a manager node you will need to also append --force
    docker swarm leave
  #+end_src

* Kubernetes
  To get the application running in kubernetes:
  #+begin_src shell
    minikube start --node=2

    minikube addons enable ingress

    kubectl apply -f project/k8s
  #+end_src

* Notes:
  Microservices are:
  - Breaking up from functions/packages to completely separate programs
  - Communicate via JSON/REST, RPC, gRPC, and over a messaging queue
  - Easier to scale
  - Easier to maintain
  - Harder to write
