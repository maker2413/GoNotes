#+TITLE: Microservices

This directory just contains Notes and sample programs I made while working
through the "[[https://www.udemy.com/course/working-with-microservices-in-go][Working with Microservices in Go]]" course on Udemy.

* Programs:
  I would work through the programs in this directory in the following order to
  follow along with the structure of the course:
  - 1. :: [[./front-end/][Front End]]
  - 2. :: [[./broker-service][Broker Service]]

* Notes:
  Microservices are:
  - Breaking up from functions/packages to completely separate programs
  - Communicate via JSON/REST, RPC, gRPC, and over a messaging queue
  - Easier to scale
  - Easier to maintain
  - Harder to write
