#+TITLE: Pointers & Errors

This section follows Pointers & Errors chapter of the [[https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/pointers-and-errors][Learn Go with Tests]].

Towards the end of this chapter we go over the [[https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/pointers-and-errors#unchecked-errors][errcheck]] package to scan our
code and find scenarios we aren't testing for.
