#+TITLE: Building a module in Go

This directory just contains Notes and sample programs I made while working
through the "[[https://www.udemy.com/course/building-a-module-in-go-golang/][Building a module in Go]]" course on Udemy.

* Programs:
  This course is going to build out a go module similar to:
  https://github.com/tsawler/toolbox. This directory will contain code for the
  module itself and an application that will use the module:
  - 1. :: [[./tookit/][Module]]
  - 2. :: [[./app/][Application]]

* Notes:
  In Go 1.18 the Go team added a feature called workspaces. This features allows
  you to generate a file called ~go.work~, which will allow you to work with
  multiple modules simultaneously. You can see a ~go.work~ file in this
  directory. This was generated with the following command:
  #+begin_src shell
    go work init toolkit app
  #+end_src

  More info can be found on workspaces here:
