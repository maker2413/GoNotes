// The Dining Philosophers problem is well known in computer science circles.
// Five philosophers, numbered from 0 through 4, live in a house where the
// table is laid for them; each philosohper has their own plate at the table.
// Their only difficulty - besides those of philosophy - is that the dish
// served is a very difficult kind of spaghetti which has to be eaten with two
// forks. There are two forks next to each plate, so that presents no
// difficulty. As a consequence, however, this means that no two neighbors may
// be eating simultaneously, since there are five philosophers and five forks.

// This is a simple implementation of Dijkstra's solution to the "Dining
// Philosophers" dilemna.

// Philosopher is a struct which stores information about a philosopher.
