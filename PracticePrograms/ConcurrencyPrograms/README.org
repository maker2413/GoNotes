#+TITLE: Concurrency Notes

In go every single program even a simple little hello world program has at least
one thread. This is the main thread of your program that gets created and
executes your code at execution.

* Channels
  - A means of allowing communication to and from a GoRoutine
  - Channels can be buffered, or unbuffered
  - Once you're done with a channel, you must close it
  - Channels typically only accept a given type or interface
