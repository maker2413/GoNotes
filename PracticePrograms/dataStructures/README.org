#+TITLE: Data Structures

This is just some programs that build out some simple data structures like
stacks, queues, linked lists, binary search trees, and more.

* Complete Data Structures:
  Here are the individual data structures found in this directory:
  - [[./stacks.go][Stack]]
  - [[./queue.go][Queue]]
  - [[./linked_list.go][Linked List]]
  - [[./bst.go][Binary Search Tree]]

  To test any of these data structures you can simply run the included unit
  tests with the following:
  #+begin_src shell
    go test -cover -v .
  #+end_src
