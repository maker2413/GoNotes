#+TITLE: Building Web Applications with Go

This directory just contains Notes and sample programs I made while working
through the "[[https://www.udemy.com/course/building-web-applications-with-go-intermediate-level/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING][Building Web Applications with Go]]" course on Udemy.

In this course we will be building out a simple web server that process credit
card transactions via [[https://stripe.com/][Stripe]]: [[./webApp/][Web Application]]

In this course we will also be using an application called [[https://github.com/air-verse/air][air]] to live reload
our web pages as we develop them. You can install air with the following
command:
#+begin_src shell
  go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
#+end_src
