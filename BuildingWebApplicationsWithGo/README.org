#+TITLE: Building Web Applications with Go

This directory just contains Notes and sample programs I made while working
through the "[[https://www.udemy.com/course/building-web-applications-with-go-intermediate-level/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING][Building Web Applications with Go]]" course on Udemy.

In this course we will be building out a simple web server that process credit
card transactions via [[https://stripe.com/][Stripe]].

In this course we will also be using an application called [[https://github.com/air-verse/air][air]] to live reload
our web pages as we develop them. You can install air with the following
command:
 #+begin_src shell
   go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
 #+end_src

* Running the app:
  To start the DB:
  #+begin_src shell
    make startdb
  #+end_src

  Connect with DB client of choice and create a new database called
  ~widgets~. After the database has been created run:
  #+begin_src sql
    grant all on widgets.* to 'maker'@'%' identified by 'verysecret';
  #+end_src

  After that you can install soda:
  #+begin_src shell
    go install github.com/gobuffalo/pop/v6/soda@latest
  #+end_src

  And finally you can apply the sql files to create our tables with:
  #+begin_src shell
    soda migrate
  #+end_src

  To generate new migrations with soda you can run:
  #+begin_src shell
    soda generate <NameOfMigration>
  #+end_src
