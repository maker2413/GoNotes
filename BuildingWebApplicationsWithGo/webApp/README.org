Start DB:
#+begin_src shell
  make startdb
#+end_src

Connect with DB client of choice and create a new database called
~widgets~. After the database has been created run:
#+begin_src sql
  grant all on widgets.* to 'maker'@'%' identified by 'verysecret';
#+end_src

After that you can install soda:
#+begin_src shell
  go install github.com/gobuffalo/pop/v6/soda@latest
#+end_src

And finally you can apply the sql files to create our tables with:
#+begin_src shell
  soda migrate
#+end_src
